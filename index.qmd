## Motivation

To date, there is no widespread usage of 3D statistical graphics outside of 2D projections. They are generally considered to be items of interest, without a formal role in data interpretations.

# Background

## Evaluation of 3D Charts

There are many possible metrics to evaluate the qualities of a chart ^[@vanderplas2020] ^[@vanderplas2017] ^[@buja2009] ^[@cleveland1984] ^[@peña2020].

-   Accuracy

-   Response times

-   Pattern recognition

-   Memorability

-   Preference

## Types of 3D charts

3D charts can be grouped into one of two categories.

::::: columns
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .column width="45%\""}
**Decorative 3D**

-   2D charts converted drawn to have artificial axis
-   Considered to be "chart junk"[^3]
-   Static renderings
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="45%\""}
**Informational 3D**

-   All axes convey information
-   Intuitive use cases
-   Static or interactive renderings
:::

## Data beyond a screen

Many studies on 2D and 3D charts have one key limitation: they are limited to 3D charts presented on 2D surfaces. With modern technology, we are able to create 3D charts in our 3D world via 3D-printing. The rising popularity and decreasing cost of 3D printers makes this option more feasible to implement in the communication of data.

::: notes
-   @kraus2020 uses VR
:::

## Why study 3D-printed charts?

There are several reasons to explore this medium of statistical graphics.

- Interactions are more natural than digitized counterparts
- Increased recall of information ^[@stusakEvaluatingMemorabilityPhysical2015] ^[@stusakIfYourMind2016]
- Realistic use cases for informational/educational purposes


## Research Objectives

Data physicalization of statistical graphics has not been widely studied. In our research, we are broadly studying the following questions:

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Do 3D-printed charts follow patterns found in previous studies that compared different types of charts?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Are 3D-printed charts better or worse than their digitized counterparts (2D and 3D renderings) regarding numerical accuracies of stimuli ratio comparisons?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   How do students participating in our experiments reflect on the scientific process, both as a participant and when viewing the study through the eyes of a researcher?
:::

:::{.notes}
I believe only there are only a couple of studies that focus on the memorability of statistical graphics

## Background

The relationship between 2D and 3D bar charts presented on paper or computer screens has been widely studied.

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Accuracy tends to be worse than 2D equivalents, although not always with statistical significance [@zacks1998; @siegrist1996; @melodycarswell1991; @stewart2009].
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   More time is needed to answer questions than 2D equivalents [@siegrist1996; @fischer2000; @stewart2009].
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   2D charts chosen more often when used for numerical estimations, although 3D is chosen more often when presenting results to others [@levy1996; @fisher1997; @stewart2009].
:::

## Overview of Project 1

While early testing of statistical graphics started in the early 20th century [^4] [^5], a major study was conducted by @cleveland1984 to provide guidance on better visualization practices. In their study, numerical estimations of stimuli ratios showed differences in various methods of data representation.

In our study, we partially replicate Cleveland and McGill's study, including the additional factor of chart medium.

### Experimental Design

-   Treatments
    -   Ratio (10)
    -   Graph type (5)
-   Responses
    -   Correctly identify smaller value of stimuli pair
    -   $\log_2(|\text{Error}|+1/8)$
-   Procedure
    -   5 practice graphs followed by 50 graphs in an identical randomized order for each participant

## Project 1

Our first project partially replicates and expands on the first experiment by @cleveland1984.

```{r}
tribble(
  ~Component,	~`Our Research`, 	~`Cleveland and McGill`,
'# of ratios',	'7 ratios',	'10 ratios (7 unique)',
'# of chart types',	'2',	'5',
'# of media types',	'3 (2D and 3D digitized, 3D printed)',	'1 (2D on paper)',
'# of charts/participant', '15',	'50'
) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

::: notes
To get 15 graphs per participant, we used incomplete blocking of 5 on the seven ratios. The type of chart was randomly allotted so that number of Type 1 and Type 3 charts were approximately the same.

After the pilot study, a static 3D chart was included into the study.

## Project 1 Results

![Results from pilot study conducted for the 3D bar chart experiment.](images/project1-results.png){#fig-project1-results fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Using a generalized additive model (GAM), the only significant effect was either replicating Type 1 or Type 3. In the pilot study, we had 38 participants, so it is likely that the experiment was under-powered.

-   Integration of the experiment into Stat 218 has provided many more responses, but results have not yet been analyzed.
:::

# Project 2: Experiential Learning

## Experiential Learning

In a dual purpose role, a large sample was obtained for the two previous projects by incorporating the experiments as an experiential learning opportunity for Stat 218 students. This is a six stage project that follows students from participants to consumers of scientific knowledge.

:::

## Background

Unlike decorative 3D elements, direct comparisons of dimensionality is more limited when the third dimension coveys information.

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Accuracy is worse for volumes than for areas [@croxton1932].
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   3D charts can sometimes better encode information than 2D charts [@barfield1989].
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   3D heat maps have lower error rates than 2D heat maps in virtual reality [@kraus2020].
:::

::: notes
-   @kraus2020 talks about more time needed for 3D charts
-   Also, @kraus2020 mentioned 2D was better for overview tasks
:::

## Overview of Project 3

We maintain the same objective when adding information to the third dimension: does numerical accuracy of ratio estimations differ between dimensionality and projections of chart types. However, it is important to note that direct translations of 2D and 3D heatmaps require different visual cues.

::: {#fig-color-height layout-ncol="2"}

![Stretched height scale](images/height-color-2.png){#fig-tall3d}

:::

::: notes
2D heat maps use color, 3D heat maps use height and can possibly use color as well.
:::



## Stimuli Construction

```{r}
load('stimuli.rda')
```

The design of the 3D heat map experiment uses the method of constant stimuli: ratios are estimated with respect to one stimuli height that remains the same.

Setting 50 as the constant and 90 as the maximum, a sequence of stimuli are chosen by equally partitioning the ratios between $50/50=1$ and $50/90\approx0.556$. The same ratios are used when setting 50 as the maximum in the stimuli pair.

# Contribution to literature

## Contribution to literature

Nearly all studies involving statistical graphics use paper-printed or digitized charts, resulting in a knowledge gap in statistical graphics presented in tangible formats. Our contributions are as follows:

:::{.incremental}
1. Explore the relationship of physical dimensionality on bar charts / heat maps using numerical accuracy of ratio estimations.
2. Provide recommendations on the construction of 3D-printed statistical graphics.
3. Explore how students interact with the process of scientific investigation using a "hands-on" statistical study.
:::

:::{.notes}
Exceptions include tactile charts, virtual reality, and artistic data physicalization. However, the interaction with these differs vastly with our 3D printed charts.

## Project 1

Using a linear mixed model approach, a suitable model is: 

$$
\log_2(|\text{Error}|+ 1/8)=\mu+R_i+T_j+M(R)_{k(i)} + \gamma_l + \omega_{lm} +  \epsilon_{ijklmn}
$$

where

- $R_i$ is the effect of ratio i
- $T_j$ is the effect of type j
- $M(R)_{k(i)}$ is the effect of Media k nested in Ratio i
- $\gamma_l\sim N(0,\sigma^2_{kit})$ 
- $\omega_{lm}\sim N(0,\sigma^2_{sub-kit})$ 
- $\epsilon_{ijkl}\sim N(0,\sigma^2_{e})$

## Project 1

With estimates from the pilot study, a power analysis can be conducted. Note that 18 out of 21 total kits were used in the analysis of the pilot study.

- Power > 0.8 for ratio with 1 subject / kit
- Power > 0.8 for plot(ratio) with 2 subjects / kit
- Power > 0.8 for chart type with 17 subjects / kit


- $n=1$ per kit: Power > 0.8 for ratio of 46.4 between 3dd and 3dp
- $n=10$ per kit: Power > 0.8 for 5/21 plot(ratio) comparisons
- $n=20$ per kit: Power > 0.8 for 11/21 plot(ratio) comparisons
- $n=40$ per kit: Power > 0.8 for 13/21 plot(ratio) comparisons

Power is low when the ratio is 17.8 and 56.2. Also note that $n=40$ per kit equates to $840$ total subjects across 21 kits, which is reasonable given the number of Stat 218 students enrolled across multiple semesters.

## Project 3

What is the benefit of using the same ratio twice?

```{r}
#| label: fig-diff-ratio
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of ratios and difference of each stimuli pairs."
stimuli %>% 
  mutate(diff = round(map2_dbl(values, constant, \(x,y)(max(x,y)-min(x,y))),1),
         ratio = round(map2_dbl(values, constant, \(x,y)(min(x,y)/max(x,y))), 2),
         constant.in.pair = case_when(
           values == constant ~ 'Stimuli are same value',
           values < constant ~ 'Constant is larger',
           values > constant ~ 'Constant is smaller'
         )) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ratio, y = diff, color = constant.in.pair)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'H') +
  labs(x = 'Ratio of stimuli',
       y = 'Difference of stimuli',
       color = 'Stimuli status') + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

::: notes
Since color does not have a direct translation to height, it is a good idea to see if ratio estimations are different depending on the physical different of the bars on the heat map. 

Using the method of constant stimuli, stimuli pairs have a larger difference for smaller ratios.

- If there is a difference in ratio estimations between stimuli pairs at the same ratio, then we show that the physical difference is also an important factor, meaning that future studies need to take this into consideration
