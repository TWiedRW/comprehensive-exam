# Motivation

## Motivation

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="45%\""}
Modern statistical graphics exist largely within the confines of 2D projections.

-   Research articles
-   Textbooks
-   Documentation / reports
-   News articles

::: incremental
Why?

-   Easy to make
-   Low cost to produce
-   Many available software options

## Motivation

The rise in computer graphics also included the pioneering of 3D graphical renderings [^1] [^2]. Many software programs include options for creating such charts, including:

## Motivation

To date, there is no widespread usage of 3D statistical graphics outside of 2D projections. They are generally considered to be items of interest, without a formal role in data interpretations.

# Background

## Background

Types of 3D charts can be grouped into one of two categories.

::::: columns
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .column width="45%\""}
**Decorative 3D**

-   2D charts converted drawn to have artificial axis
-   Considered to by "chart junk"
-   Static renderings

::: {.fragment .column width="45%\""}
**Informational 3D**

-   All axes convey information
-   XXX
-   Static or interactive renderings

## Evaluation of 3D Charts

Results

## Data beyond a screen

All of reported results have one key limitation: they are limited to 3D charts presented on 2D surfaces. Modern technology has made it feasible to create ...

The availability and cheapening costs of 3D printers have made physical 3D charts a feasible option in displaying graphics.

![Sales of 3D printers, shown on a 3D printed chart.](images/first-3d-printed-chart.jpg){#fig-wsj2014 fig-align="center"}

## Research Objectives

Data physicalization of statistical graphics has not been widely studied. In our research, we are broadly studying the following questions:

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Do 3D-printed charts follow patterns found in previous studies that compared different types of charts?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Are 3D-printed charts better or worse than their digitized counterparts (2D and 3D renderings) regarding numerical accuracies of stimuli comparisons?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   How do students participating in our experiments reflect on the scientific process, both as a participant and when viewing the study through the eyes of a researcher?

# Project 1: 3D Bar Charts

## @cleveland1984

While early testing of statistical graphics took place in the early 20th century [^3] [^4], a major study was conducted by @cleveland1984 to provide guidance on better visualization practices.

[^3]: @croxton1927

[^4]: @vanderplas2020

This study sought to provide a ranking of Elementary Perceptual Tasks (EPTs), which are the ways in which people extract quantitative information from a graph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Examples of EPTs listed in Figure 1 of @cleveland1984.](images/cm-fig1.png){#fig-cmept fig-align="center" width="100%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Stimuli

-   Target stimuli followed $s_i=10 \times 10^{(i-1)/12},\quad i=1,\dots, 10$
-   Ratios of target stimuli: 0.178, 0.261, 0.383, 0.464 (twice), 0.562, 0.681 (twice), 0.825 (twice)

::: notes
All non-target stimuli were chosen at random, subject to constraints.
:::

### Experimental Design

-   Treatments
    -   Ratio (10)
    -   Graph type (5)
-   Responses
    -   Correctly identify smaller value of stimuli pair
    -   $\log_2(|\text{Error}|+1/8)$
-   Procedure
    -   5 practice graphs followed by 50 graphs in an identical randomized order for each participant

# Contribution to literature

## Contribution to literature

Nearly all studies involving statistical graphics use printed or digitized charts. This is reasonable given that they

The only exceptions that we found were tactile charts and virtual reality.
